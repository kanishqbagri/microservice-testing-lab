# Service Management Scripts

This directory contains scripts for managing the microservice architecture.

## üìã Available Scripts

```

### 4. `status.sh`
**Purpose**: Quick alias for status checking.

**Usage**:
```bash
./status.sh
```

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Simple alias for `check-service-status.sh`
- ‚úÖ Quick status overview

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Start All Services
```bash
./start-all-services.sh
```

### Check Status
```bash
./status.sh
```

### Stop All Services
```bash
./stop-all-services.sh
```

## üìä Exit Codes

The scripts use the following exit codes:

- **0**: Success (all services running)
- **1**: Partial success (some services running)
- **2**: Failure (most services stopped)

## üîß Configuration

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- curl (for health checks)

### Environment Variables
The scripts automatically detect and use:
- `JAVA_HOME` - Java installation path
- `MAVEN_HOME` - Maven installation path
- `DOCKER_HOST` - Docker daemon address

### Port Configuration
Default service ports:
- **8080**: Gateway Service
- **8081**: User Service
- **8082**: Product Service
- **8083**: Order Service
- **8084**: Notification Service
- **8085**: Jarvis Core
- **3000**: Frontend Dashboard

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Services Won't Start
```bash
# Check prerequisites
java -version
mvn -version
docker --version

# Check Docker is running
docker info

# Check available ports
lsof -i :8080-8085
```

#### Services Won't Stop
```bash
# Force kill all Java processes
pkill -f "spring-boot:run"

# Force kill all Maven processes
pkill -f "mvn"

# Stop Docker containers
docker-compose down
```

#### Health Checks Fail
```bash
# Check individual service health
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/health
curl http://localhost:8082/actuator/health
curl http://localhost:8083/actuator/health
curl http://localhost:8084/actuator/health
```

### Debug Mode
Run scripts with verbose output:
```bash
bash -x ./start-all-services.sh
bash -x ./stop-all-services.sh
bash -x ./check-service-status.sh
```

## üìö Service URLs

## üîÑ Continuous Monitoring

For continuous monitoring, you can:

### Set up a monitoring loop
```bash
# Check status every 30 seconds
watch -n 30 ./status.sh
```

### Create a monitoring script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
    ./status.sh
    sleep 60
done
```

### Use with cron
```bash
# Add to crontab for hourly checks
0 * * * * cd /path/to/microservices && ./status.sh >> status.log 2>&1
```

## üìù Logs

### Service Logs
Each service generates logs in its respective directory:
```bash
# View service logs
tail -f user-service/logs/application.log
tail -f product-service/logs/application.log
tail -f order-service/logs/application.log
tail -f notification-service/logs/application.log
tail -f gateway-service/logs/application.log
```

### Docker Logs
```bash
# View Docker container logs
docker-compose logs -f
docker-compose logs -f user-service
docker-compose logs -f postgres
```

## ü§ù Contributing

When modifying these scripts:

1. **Test thoroughly** - Test with services running and stopped
2. **Handle errors gracefully** - Don't let one failure stop the entire script
3. **Provide clear output** - Use colored output and descriptive messages
4. **Document changes** - Update this README when adding new features
5. **Maintain compatibility** - Ensure scripts work on macOS and Linux

## üìÑ License

These scripts are part of the microservice testing lab and follow the same license as the main project.
