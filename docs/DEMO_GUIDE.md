================================================
    ü§ñ Jarvis AI Capabilities Demo
================================================

[DEMO] Welcome to the Jarvis AI Demo!
[DEMO] This showcase demonstrates the AI-powered testing framework capabilities.

[SUCCESS] Jarvis Core is running and ready!

[DEMO] === System Health Assessment ===

[JARVIS AI] Sending command: assess current system health and identify weak points
‚è≥ Processing...

ü§ñ Jarvis AI Response:
----------------------------------------
üí¨ I understand you want to perform system health check.

Based on my analysis:
‚Ä¢ System health issues detected - may impact test reliability

I'm Performing system health check.
This should take approximately Less than 1 minute.

üìä Status: PROCESSING

üéØ Action: HEALTH_CHECK
   Description: Performing system health check
   ‚è±Ô∏è  Estimated Time: Less than 1 minute
   üéØ Priority: MEDIUM
   üéØ Confidence: 87%

```

## Troubleshooting

### Jarvis Core Not Starting
```bash
# Check Java version
java -version

# Check Maven
mvn -version

# Check port availability
lsof -i :8085

# Start with debug
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=8085 -Ddebug=true"
```

### Demo Script Issues
```bash
# Check script permissions
chmod +x demo-jarvis-simple.sh

# Check dependencies
which jq
which curl

# Test Jarvis Core manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/jarvis/command \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command": "check health"}'
```

### Common Issues
1. **Port 8085 in use**: Change port in script or kill existing process
2. **Java version mismatch**: Ensure Java 17+ is being used
3. **Maven dependencies**: Run `mvn clean install` in jarvis-core
4. **Database issues**: Check PostgreSQL connection in application.yml

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Demo Scenarios
You can modify the demo scripts to test different scenarios:

```bash
# Test specific service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/jarvis/command \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command": "run performance test on notification-service"}'

# Test chaos scenarios
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/jarvis/command \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command": "inject network latency into gateway-service"}'
```

### Interactive Testing
Use the interactive CLI for custom commands:

```bash
./jarvis-cli.sh
```

Then type commands like:
- "check health of user-service"
- "run chaos test on order-service"
- "analyze performance patterns"

## Next Steps

After running the demo:

1. **Explore the Interactive CLI**: Try `./jarvis-cli.sh`
2. **Review Test Results**: Check the database for stored results
3. **Explore Chaos Engineering**: Set up Litmus Chaos with `./scripts/setup/install-litmus.sh`
4. **Integrate with CI/CD**: Add Jarvis AI to your pipeline
5. **Customize for Your Services**: Adapt the framework for your microservices

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review the logs in `jarvis-core/jarvis.log`
3. Verify all prerequisites are met
4. Test individual components manually

## Architecture Overview

The demo showcases these key components:

- **NLP Engine**: Natural language command processing
- **AI Engine**: Intelligent analysis and decision making
- **Decision Engine**: Action planning and execution
- **Context Manager**: System state management
- **Memory Manager**: Historical data storage
- **Learning Engine**: Pattern recognition and improvement
